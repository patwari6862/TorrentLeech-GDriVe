### YOU NEED UNLIMITED TEAM/SHARE DRIVE IN ORDER TO USE THE GDRIVE FUNCIONS Flawlessly (normal GDRIVE has 15 gb of storage only)

2. Extract the downloaded zip file and run cmd(hold shift and right click) from the Extracted folder.
3. RUN rclone config and follow the onscreen instructions!
4. If done Correctly, you'll get some thing like this in the cmd ;
